# Squash Merge
- Squash merge merges branches but condenses(squashes) the commit history of the merged branches.
- This means that when we merge branches, we will not add each commit from the branch(feature) that was being worked on to the main branch. Instead  all the file changes will be added to a single new commit on the main branch.
- The difference between this and a normal merge is that a normal merge will give you a commit history, while squash merge will not.
